My mother hates this hotel now. It was her favorite hotel but tonight they checked us into a very small room and we are paying a very high price. We are long term guests and I was expecting to stay in a nice room like usual.

We were looking forward to staying here. 

They never should have sold a room to us through Hotel Tonight for such a high price for a terrible room. I called reservations before reserving this hotel and they said they could get us room with two beds. "

animats@att.net,Tue Aug 20 2019#18:09:43,10,null,I would recommend at least 4 usb ports in the room next to the bed (also inform the client beforehand !!!) Also I would recommend to get a better ventilation in the bathroom. The airconditioning in the room works fine but very noisy so during the night needs to be switched off or you can not sleep. Beside this a very pleasant stay and I would recommend to put a small fridge by default in the room

I am shocked by the presence of an external air conditioner under my window, like in a roadside motel. The absence of a thermostat means that the room is either too hot or too cold. The television periodically turns itself off and on while watching it. The appliances in the room were unplugged when I got here. The bedspread is the old, heavy, polyfiber sort that I assume does not get washed between guests."

I liked the room I had and was put into a lesser room. They were not kicked out because I was told the policy is they get a second chance. They must pay a fine but they get to stay. So the guest that did nothing wrong has to collect her own bags and move (no offer was made tho help me) and I get put in a lesser room. I have stayed with you several times.

The clicking occurs every few minutes and then the noise is repetitive for a few minutes. This made it nearly impossible to sleep! We love staying at the Hotel - this is the first time we‚Äôve had such a problem. Hope it can be fixed for future guests

One problem is there is no desk there.  I don't understand why there is a desk in the bedroom. Better in the other room.
a prior time the suite (824) the clock radio had both an electrical outlet and two USB slots, which was great. The current room, 524, had a radio with no slots at all.  Very tough to recharge units.
Internet service is very spotty, not hispeed!"
